    "We’ve learned about various packages & tools, but when do we know when to use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the easy answer is that we are sometimes told which tools to use, especially in entry-level positions, or in positions where we are given sufficient training and codebase explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a Python 3 pipeline hosted on a Docker container…\n",
    "* This is a React web-app that uses TypeScript …\n",
    "* This is a R script that uses MPI to process data in parallel …\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes we are placed in positions where we are allowed to make decisions of which tech-stack we will be using for ourselves or for our team.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which programming language do I use to make a computational vision ML model?\n",
    "* I want this pipeline to be useable by non-programmers, which programming language should I write this in?\n",
    "\n",
    "And sometimes when we are allowed to make these decisions, we might lean towards, or be directed to use some new, unfamiliar, and hyped piece of software that claims to have novel features never-before seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: The software tool, DataAnalyzur, makes data-pipelines easy to program, and dedicates 3% of computational power to mine bitcoin on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technologists are the most optimisitic people, we need to reign in this optimisim\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless your team already uses a piece of technology that you must learn, do not dedicate time to learning extraneous software tools that look interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are millions of software tools out there, our value lies in focusing on the right ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, focus on strengthening the essentials: \n",
    "* Python or R for programming pipelines\n",
    "* SQL for database management \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this like learning a language. Learning German, Spanish, Japanese, and Turkish at the same time is almost impossible. "
