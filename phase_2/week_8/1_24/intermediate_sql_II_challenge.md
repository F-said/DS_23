Another programming language commonly used by data analysts & scientists is `R`. With the proliferation of `Python`, `R` likewise rose to prominence due to its power & ease of use. Just like Python, there are a [plethora of jobs](https://community.rstudio.com/c/jobs/20) that solely utilize `R`.

While `R` knowledge is not required to run statistical learning algorithms, it can prove to be an indispensable tool when doing exploratory data analysis and computing metrics.

If you are interested in building up your `R` foundations, consult the following resources in order to download RStudio & start coding in R.
