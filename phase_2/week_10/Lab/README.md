## EPI & Various Metrics DASHBOARD

After completing your pipeline & analysis from the previous mini-project, you will now create a Tableau dashboard exploring the relationships of an EPI metric, as well as multiple metrics from your newly selected dataset (e.g. HDI).

Your dashboard will contain
* A title
* One non-parameterized map, where you plot the concentration of an EPI metric globally
* One parameterized map, where you plot the concentrations of your multiple new metrics globally
* One parameterized scatter plot where you compare the relationships between your EPI metric, and multiple new metrics
* (challenge) make the paramterized scatter plot and map utilize the same metric
* a written analysis describing your findings

After completing this dashboard, you will publish a post link to it in the README of your previous mini-project.
