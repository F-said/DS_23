# Extra Credit: Psycopg2 + Pandas Pipeline

Emulating the previous SQL-pipeline that we've engineered to figure out which airlines/airports have the highest ratio of delays, let's create a new SQL pipeline that operates on our own personal dataset.

The requirements of this project are as follows:

* Pull data from a pgAdmin database. (This means that we should be saving `csv` files into pgAdmin!)
* Load data into a pandas dataframe
* Generate summary statistics or engineer features that answer your data-related question
* Visualize via matplotlib or [sns](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
