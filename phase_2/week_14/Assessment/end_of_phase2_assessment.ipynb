    "The following assessment details 10 questions that will gauge your understanding of the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* pandas\n",
    "* SQL & auxiliary packages\n",
    "* General Data Analytics\n",
    "* Statistical Inference\n",
    "* Linear Regression \n",

    "Utilize all available resources (internet, stack-overflow, documentation, previous notes, etc) excluding collaboration. All solutions should be your own in order to accurately gauge your foundations. \n",
