# End of Phase Project 2 

Your analytics consulting company, `Central Tendecy` has recently been awarded a contract from the recruitment-advertisement tech-company `InRecruit`. You've been tasked with working on a team of other analysts in order to generate a comprehensive pipeline & analysis of job-data that they've scraped since `11/4/2022`.

Mainly, `InRecruit` seeks to address the following inferential questions:

* What are the most sought-after skills for data-analyst positions?
* Which **cities** are hiring the most data-analysts?
* Which **companies** are hiring the most data-analysts?
* How do salary outcomes differ between remote-work & non-remote work?

As well as make the following predictive models:

* Can we predict standardized salary using a regression model if we know the skills required, schedule, & option for remote work?

To better help understand this dataset & the requirements of this project the companies [planning documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z4EwdbyfUzf-FuRTJfVMaRSm5-R25viA?usp=share_link) have been shared with you.

While you are not allowed to directly log into the companies `aws` account, you will be given credentials to directly pull tables from their [AWS Relational Database](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/). To get these credentials, you will have to meet with the pseudo-staff of `InRecruit` (Mo & Farukh). In this case, you will be scheduling a 1:1 via calendly.

Keep in mind that these credentials **must** be hidden!

* extract.ipynb
* transform.ipynb
* eda.ipynb
* predict.ipynb
* config.py & gitignore
* README.md

the following folders must also be created

* data/
* images/

Below describes the specifications & requirements for each file:

### extract.ipynb



### transform.ipynb



### eda.ipynb



### predict.ipynb



## README.md

After completing your analysis, you **must** create a README describing your **methodology**, **visuals**, **results**, & **next-actions**. Any repository without a README will not be accepted.
