If we would like to have the ability to switch columns in a Tableau worksheet, we must name this parameter, set the data type to be `string` and specify a `list` of allowable values (unless we want the ability to switch between all available columns).\n",

    "After hitting `ok` we then successfully create a dropdown menu that controls parameters.\n",

    "## Tableau Query Language\n",
    "\n",
    "In the markdown box above, we mentioned writing out a `CASE` \"query\" to implement some functionality in our dashboard. To be clear, this isn't any type of language-specific query (such as SQL), but is instead a general language used by Tableau.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a new calculated field, this always gives us a new `pill` to interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over some use-cases and basics of this language, starting with the main types of calculations we will find.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest form of calculation, which entails calculating some metric or aggregate according to a row or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level of Detail Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an advanced form of `Basic Calculations`, which entails modifying granularity of rows/columns selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Table calculations entail transforming values at the visual-level only.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving with these types of calculations, let's review syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our query language, we have access to:\n",
    "* Functions (`IF`, `THEN`, `ELSEIF`, `END`, `AVG`, `ABS`)\n",
    "* Fields (Measures, Dimensions in your worksheet)\n",
    "* Operators (`+, - , /, *, >, <, >=, <=`)\n",
    "* Literal Expressions (constants, strings `5`, `Hello world!`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field Names\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields, which are just your measures & dimensions, must always be surrounded by square-brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: Say you have a `revenue` measure and you want to create a calculated field on this. You would include it in your calculation as `[revenue]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If-Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in all other programming languages, we have access to `if` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the structure of this if-statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "IF [Profit per Day] > 000 THEN \"Highly Profitable\"\n",
    "ELSEIF [Profit per Day] <= 0 THEN \"Unprofitable\"\n",
    "ELSE\"Profitable\"\n",
    "END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we create an if-statement control flow via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "IF <conditional> THEN <return_val>\n",
    "ELSEIF <conditional> THEN <return_val>\n",
    "ELSEIF <conditional> THEN <return_val>\n",
    "ELSEIF <conditional> THEN <return_val>\n",
    "ELSE <return_val>\n",
    "END \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case\n",
    "\n",
    "In other programming languages, we call this a `switch` statement. This is designed to easily check for equality and behaves the exact same way as multiple `IF` and `ELSEIF` statements looking for equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CASE [field]\n",
    "WHEN <value> THEN <return_val>\n",
    "WHEN <value> THEN <return_val>\n",
    "WHEN <value> THEN <return_val>\n",
    "WHEN <value> THEN <return_val>\n",
    "END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The value that we point to at the end will be the value of the calculated field.\n",
