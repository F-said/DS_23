Congratulations on reaching Phase 4! 

Now that we have a variety of projects to showcase our skills in Python, SQL, & Tableau, it's time to appropriately make them present on our GitHub profiles for maximum exposure.

As individuals first starting in this field, recruiters and other engineers will use your GitHub profile to get a sense of your code quality, documentation practices, language familiarity, as well as your ability to work on a team.

In addition, any company "business logic" that you create in the future will be hidden through the means of SSH keys & private repositories. For this reason, you most likely will not be able to reveal the code you have written for enterprise.

For this reason, we want to make sure that our public GitHub portfolio satisfies a few pre-conditions before we reveal it to potential employers.

* It reveals your ability to work on a team
* It reveals your familiarity with your language of choice (in our case, Python)
* It reveals your interests
* It's easy to explore

To satisfy these conditions we want to ask everyone in the data track to walk through the steps below and then submit their GitHub profile to the following [Google classroom link](https://classroom.google.com/c/NTQ2NzMzMDQwMDM5/a/NjE1MzczMjU2ODkw/details) for review.

1. **Complete incomplete READMEs**
    1. All projects on your public GitHub profile **must** contain a README. This gives potential viewers a starting point in your repository.
2. **Customize your Pins**
    1. Pinned projects are a great way to show off your expertise & interests to profile viewers. Read [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile) to figure out how to pin projects.
    2. You should be selective in your "pinning" and only pin projects that represent a *functioning* project that also contains some novelty. For example, you should pin your capstone projects. On the other hand, the Titanic dataset analysis should most likely not be pinned.  
3. **Delete/Archive Irrelevant Projects**
    1. Creating empty repositories is a great way to get familiar with GitHub cloning, but probably doesn't reveal too much about your competency in creating a data analytics project. For this reason, they should most likely be deleted.
4. **Creating a Profile README (Optional)**
    1. And finally, we can also create a brief developer introduction to our profiles by generating a [GitHub README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme). This step is optional, but if you'd like to make a quick "digital business-card", read the previous link to get started.

This will be due July 10th.
