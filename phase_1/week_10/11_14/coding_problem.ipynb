    "As data analysts, we must become pros at iterating & manupulating data. Especially in conjunction with computing calculations. Our ability and experience in this sort of computational thinking is our strength. Let's practice this skill below.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a list of sorted numbers in ascending order. I want to insert a number into this list, but ensure that order is kept. Write a function called `insert_order(lst, num)` that takes in a list called `lst` and the number `num` you want to insert, and inserts our `num` in the correct position. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "My list is `[4, 10, 12, 24, 64]` and my number is `13`. Calling `insert_order([4, 10, 12, 24, 64], 13)` will modify the list to be: `[4, 10, 12, 13, 24, 64]`.\n",
