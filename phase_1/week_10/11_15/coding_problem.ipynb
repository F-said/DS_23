    "\n",
    "1. Solve the problem on paper before you solve attempt to write code. However, if you are stuck, just write the basic control-flow structures that you know you need. For example, which control flow structure gets us every single element from this list?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Think about which data-structure we need to keep track of the running sum of this entire list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you almost have your solution, but one bug is holding you back from completing all test cases, look carefully at the specific type of error Python is throwing. If it's a `TypeError`, perhaps we need a type-cast. If we have an `IndexError`, then perhaps we are accessing an index that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Focus on getting a working solution before attempting to improve time or space complexity."
