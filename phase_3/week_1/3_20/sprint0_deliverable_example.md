## Background Research

* [Khan Academy](https://blog.khanacademy.org/harnessing-ai-so-that-all-students-benefit-a-nonprofit-approach-for-equal-access/)
* [Chat GPT API](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis)
* [Teach with GPT - NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html)

Write a summary of your findings below these bullet points

ChatGPT & other gpt models have the ability to be intentional & intelligent learning assistants if parameters are properly tuned & problem-sets are fed.

Attempts in this domain are fairly fresh and limited, so this would be an interesting & novel way to progress the domain of educational software.

## Problem Definition

Solve the problem of cooridination between student & instructor to create an automated learning assistant that will assist the process of self-discovery in an intelligent and purposeful workflow.

In addition, if we prevent the chat model from giving answers and ONLY support testing, this will likewise support novel discovery within the student.

## Value

This is valuable to TKH, as teaching staff can dedicate more time to generating asynchronous material & lecture prep.

This is valuable to other education organizations, as this provides another case study of the potential applications of AI in useful & interesting ways.

## Limitations

* Chat learning model does not adjust well to student question
* potentially leads students down the wrong path
* problem is too-complex to solve in a 12 week period.

## Solutions

* Allow for student feedback on model for self-improvement
* Intensive testing period where staff tries to force model down wrong path
* ONLY MVP is generated in 12 weeks.

## Tech Stack

* Django for web-interface
* Python 
* Whisper API
* Natural Language Processing
