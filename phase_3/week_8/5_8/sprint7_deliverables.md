## Sprint 7 Deliverables

### Implement Load & Begin EDA 
 
Using `sqlalchemy`, you will create a jupyter notebook that extracts data from your amazon database and loads it back into your pipeline. You will save this data into a subfolder called `data/clean` that you will use for subsequent analysis & dashboard engineering.

This will be completed via the script:

* `load_data.ipynb`

### Implement pl/sql Functions

Within your database, you will also implement 3 functions that calculate important metrics that a non-technically minded manager (us) might want to discover.

### Implement SQLAlchemy to call Functions from Command Line

In addition to this script, you will also implement a command-line-interface.

Utilize the skeleton code labeled `query.py` located within this folder.

### Further Develop Documentation

As always, ensure that you are properly documenting code 

### Ensure Branching

Going forward, we will check commit history to ensure that

### Collect More Data (If Applicable) & Integrate



### Tackle Recommended Next Actions
