## Sprint 2

Your minimal viable model be an ETL pipeline that does the following simple tasks:
* Extracts data from your csv files
* Does light & minimal data transformations
    * Drop null rows, rename columns, etc
* Saves data back into csv files
* Generates a rough regression model with NO FEATURE SELECTION
  * What Andrew Ng calls a “Quick & Dirty Model”
  
Similar to the `predict.ipynb` file of yours End of Phase 2 Project.

Demo the results of this pipeline in a quick 5 minutes via guided presentation or slides.
At most, this should be two jupyter notebooks.

## Sprint 3

After completing your MVP ETL, complete an MVP EDA:
* Univariate:
    * Summary Statistics
    * Histograms
    * Box-Plots
    * Confidence Intervals 
    * KS-Test
* Bivariate:
    * Scatter-Plots
    * Correlation Map

Similar to the `eda.ipynb` file of yours End of Phase 2 Project.

Demo the results of this EDA in a quick 5 minutes via guided presentation or slides.
At most, this should be one jupyter notebook.

You will implement these jupyter notebooks in your GitHub repository and push your changes. Every team member should contribute to developing this code. You will submit your Github link to the following Google classroom link with all completed files.
