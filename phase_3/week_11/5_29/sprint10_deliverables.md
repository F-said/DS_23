## Sprint 10 Deliverables

### Implement Dashboarding

Complete your tableau dashboard after generating your template. This should describe a discrete data-story that you've gleaned from your EDA & CDA.

### Continue work On Presentation

Continue work on your slides. Plan and rehearse your presentation. Each team member should be presenting.

### Further Develop Documentation

As always, ensure proper documentation. You must be able to understand the motivation for your code one year after this project completes.

### Ensure Branching

Going forward we will check commit history to ensure that each team member is contributing equally to the codebase, so be sure to work solely in a branch-based environment!

### Tackle Recommended Next Actions

Lastly, if you are complete with all sprint specifications, a good chunk of next actions would be the recommnended code-quality changes as listed in your feedback.
