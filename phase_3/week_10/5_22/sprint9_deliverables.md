## Sprint 9 Deliverables

### Implement CDA

After completing plans for your models, you should then implement all 4 models. This will entail:

* further cleaning your data if applicable
* generating appropriate train-test splits
* generating and fitting models
* observing significance and importance of features
* observing accuracy of model

For your final discussion of your dataset, you should utilize the model that displays the least error within your test set. You should also utilize the statistical inference from the other 3 models to motivate your discussion & findings.

Be wary of multicollinearity and make sure that you are utilizing the appropriate model given the nature of your dataset. If you find a large number of insignificant features, re-generate your statistical learning model with only the significant features attached.

In addition, check for multicollinearity by utilizing the ANOVA test or via the correlation heat-map.

### Draft Findings

After completing your `EDA`, draft your observations in a your README and detail what information you've gleaned from your visual analysis. Be sure to include visualizations, but do not use more than 5 graphs. This document must describe the following sections listed below.

Please ensure that this discussion is well-edited and concise. Think of this as a formal report that multiple individuals will utilize for business decisions. Do NOT include the place-holder text below.

> ### Distributions
> (place-holder text) What distributions did you notice throughout your EDA? Were any
> attributes normally distributed? If not, what methods can you take to force normality?
> 
> ### Relationships
> (place-holder text) What interesting metrics did you glean from your EDA? Did any box-plots, confidence intervals, or scatter plots
> appear to model significant relationships? 
>
> ### Models
> (place-holder text) What models did you use and why? What outcomes did your model predict? What might this hint about the relationship of your data?

### Plan Dashboarding

Using draw.io, plan the structure and data story of your analysis. This will be the template that you will use to motivate the design of your final tableau dashboard.

### Plan Presentation

Lastly, begin planning your presentation. This presentation should include the following sections:

1. Goal Description & Importance
2. Data Sources
3. Methodology & Design
4. Exploratory Analysis 
5. Confirmatory Insights 
6. Prescriptions
7. Dashboard
8. Next Steps
9. Conclusion & Questions 
10. Relevant Links for Follow-Up

A template presentation is attached here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UHOOkefCKwYjEmB9N7H1_qpYjUpddfuxAAQyoIBAsuU/edit?usp=sharing

Be sure to acknowledge the fact that your audience will be a mix of low-technical knowledge and high-domain knowledge. That is, they might not be aware as to what a decision tree is, but they will understand the motivations for prescriptive steps.

And lastly, be sure to employ color and visualizations to keep audience attention.

### Further Develop Documentation

As always, ensure proper documentation. You must be able to understand the motivation for your code one year after this project completes.

### Ensure Branching

Going forward we will check commit history to ensure that each team member is contributing equally to the codebase, so be sure to work solely in a branch-based environment!

### Collect More Data (If Applicable) & Integrate

Remember! The more data the better. Always be on the lookout for ways collect relevant data to increase the statistical power of your observations.

### Tackle Recommended Next Actions

Lastly, if you are complete with all sprint specifications, a good chunk of next actions would be the recommnended code-quality changes as listed in your feedback.
