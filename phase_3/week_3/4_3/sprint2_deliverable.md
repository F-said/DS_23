# Sprint 2 Deliverables

## Develop a Minimal Viable Model/Product

Develop a minimal viable product of your data analytics capstone project. This should be contained in just one (two at most) jupyter notebooks that display your steps & logic.

The steps of your MVP should include:

1. Loading data from some data source.
    1. If your data entails web-scraping, include or refer to it in your model!
2. Transforming data.
    1. This should be a simple removal of nulls, or transformation of columns.
    2. It could entail feature engineering if required.
3. Predicting on data.
    1. Utilize a linear regression model to predict some quantitative target using a subset of features from your dataframe
    2. Make sure to utilize the metrics & techniques we've learned in the previous week while working on this model.

## Present Findings

Demonstrate your findings in either a small batch of slides or a simple demo. 

This should include of the following discussion points at the minimum:

* Your methodology
    * where did the data come from?  
    * what transformations did you implement and why?
* Your results
    * what is the accuracy of your model?
* Next steps
    * what does your analysis show? how can you expand these findings into next-steps?

Each team member should have a section to present, and the presentation should only last 10 minutes.
