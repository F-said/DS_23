### Draft Findings



### Further Develop Documentation



### Ensure Branching

Going forward we will check commit history to ensure that each team member is contributing equally to the codebase, so be sure to work solely in a branch-based environment!

### Collect More Data (If Applicable) & Integrate

Remember! The more data the better. Always be on the lookout for ways to increase your statistical power.

### Tackle Recommended Next Actions
