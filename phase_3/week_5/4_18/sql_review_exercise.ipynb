    "You are tasked with designing a conceptual database for a parking lot with only one level. The parking lot has multiple parking spots, and cars can park in these spots. Each car has a unique license plate number and an alloted set of time that in can be in a parking spot. What information do you think needs to be stored in the database to keep track of which spots are available and which cars are parked where? Consider the relationships between the parking spots and cars.\n",
