## Sprint 5 Deliverables

### Psycopg2 Script

For sprint 5, you will create a script that uses `psycopg2` to create and insert data into a schema. Once again, you will be utilizing the amazon `rds` instance to save your data.



You do not have to submit these self-reflections in google classroom, but we still recommend you write down the answers to these questions in some shared document that all group members can look back to.

You will be submitting a link to your GitHub profile as part of your Sprint 5 deliverables. This will be due on Wednesday `5/2`.
