## Sprint 5 Deliverables

### Develop a Schema in SQL

You will write a SQL script to create a schema and the subsequent tables that belong to this schema. Take a look at `fix-me-week5` to figure out how this schema should be written.

You will develop this script and push it to your GitHub repository. Be sure to test this script in pgAdmin to ensure its functionality. 

### Further Develop Documentation

As you implement your code & plan out your database, you should also succinctly describe these additional features in your respective `README`. In addition, you should ensure that your code is properly documented as you push your changes.

### Begin Branching

If you haven't started doing so already, each team member should be working on their own branch and then integrating these changes up to the main branch. We will be checking commit history to ensure that each team member is pushing purposeful code.

### Collect More Data & Integrate

Lastly, you should aim to collect at least one more csv file to throw in the mix of your analysis. After all, our statistical power only increases with the sample size.

This additional csv file should be appropriately cleaned and transformed to fall in line with the rest of your data that you've gathered so far. 

If you've hit a "ceiling" as to the amount of data that can be collected (on the account of not having the appropriate resources, or just not being able to find more data), feel free to skip this step.

### Implement Recommended Changes

And lastly, you've all been given recommended changes after your first presentations. Please ensure that all these recommended next actions have been implemented.

All of these changes should be reflected on your GitHub repository. 

You will be submitting a link to your GitHub profile as part of your Sprint 5 deliverables. This will be due on Wednesday `5/2`.
