    "Python is the programming language of winners.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in all seriousness, Python has become the go-to language for numerous developers, analysts, and engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because Python is highly flexible, we could find ourselves using Python in a variety of contexts:\n",
    "* Engineering a dynamic website that connects to a database via Django\n",
    "* Designing a data pipeline that extracts & transforms data\n",
    "* Programming a script that runs in the background of someone's computer & keeps track of keyboard-clicks\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python is not the only language that a data developer should interest themselves in. I recommend taking a look at the following languages at some point in your journey of self-studying. \n",

    "* [C](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0)\n",

    "* [Scala](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/index.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is dynamically-typed (or type-less)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "x = \"hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is completely unnessecary to indicate types in Python! This sometimes spoils us, as almost all other programming languages need types. Take a look at how we create variables in the `c` programming langauge.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int x = 5;\n",
    "char* c = \"hello\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is an interpreted language\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of computer languages, we have two ways to execute a program:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **interpretation** : an interpreter reads a file line by line and executes individual steps of the program\n",
    "* **compilation** : a compiler translates a file into machine code, and then this binary file is run independently of the compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "While compilation usually takes more time to complete than interpretation, it actually produces a binary file that has faster execute time than an interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is an object oriented language\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that **everything** in Python is an object. And likewise keep in mind that an object is just a bundle of data that contains `methods` (behavior) and `attributes` (descriptors). This indicates that almost every data-type that we create in Python has attributes & methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = \"hello!\"\n",
    "print(x.upper())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we really boil this concept down to its bare utility, we see that Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP) is a realization of the concept of digitization of the real world. We are attempting to describe **all** types of objects within a digital space, whether abstract (such as an available time-slot) or physical (such as an Amazon order).\n",
    "\n",
    "This unfortunately works towards our detriment when we are trying to create programs that have fast execute-time. Creating an object entails **huge** overhead in memory & time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: extra-time or cost needed to do something. *ex*: Buying a pie vs baking a pie. *Sure baking a pie probably tastes better, but there is huge overhead associated with that.*\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP however is not the only school of thought that exists, I recommend exploring [Scala](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/index.htm) if you're interested in other paradigms of programming/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is open source\n",
    "\n",
    "We are free to make a profit, build an organization, or tear down an organization (maybe) all in the context of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few code-blocks, we will go over some basic fundemental concepts of Python, as well as new & exciting features that will allow us to become more **powerful** developers."

    "## Basic Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Our universe is made out of fundemental & microscopic components such as neutrons & electrons. The unique arrangement of these components lead to nuance & interesting structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similairly, we can boil down our data-types in Python to some essential types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* int : whole numbers with no decimal\n",
    "* char : single character (notice how I am not talking about strings!)\n",
    "* float : number with decimal\n",
    "* boolean : true or false \n",
    "\n",
    "There are of course more data-types than just these 4, but these are the most widely used amongst all programming languages. In addition, these are the most fundemental and any other data-type is actually just an extension (or limitation) on these data-types! For example, we have a concept called an `unsigned int` in `c`. This is actually just an int without a sign! AKA A strictly positive int.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, these data-types are apparent in almost every other programming language, albeit more *explicitly*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explicit**: Making itself obviously known\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example the `c` programming language. Notice how each data-type is *explicitly* written out:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int x = 5;\n",
    "char c = 'h';\n",
    "float f = 3.14159;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python on the other-hand is *implicitly-typed*. This means that the Python interpreter does **not** want you worrying about types as you are coding your programs! Instead, the interpreter looks at the data you are assigning to variables, and assigns type as it executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Interpreter Vision: I see you want an int\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interpreter Vision: I see you want a char\n",
    "c = 'h'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interpreter Vision: I see you want a float\n",
    "f = 3.14159\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you should prefer `explicit`-typing or `implicit`-typing is mostly up to you. Some prefer explicit types since it enables static type-checking at compile time. This allows your compiler to check that you have not made an obvious mistake before allowing your program to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "C Static Typing\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int x = 5;\n",
    "\n",
    "// toupper is a builtin function that only takes characters. However, we are passing an int. Your compiler will catch this.\n",
    "toupper(x);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Dynamic Typing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# define a topupper function\n",
    "def toupper(x):\n",
    "    return x.upper()\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python will happily allow this program to run, even though it is impossible to uppercase an int\n",
    "toupper(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, other's prefer the wild-west nature of dynamic typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# a function that adds\n",
    "def adder(v1, v2):\n",
    "    return v1 + v2\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "z = \"hello\"\n",
    "a = \" world\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# the future is now!\n",

    "## Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this discussion of basic data-types, we also have simple operations that we can use to create calculations, combined values, & more. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, they are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Addition: `+`\n",
    "* Concatenation: (joining together two or more strs/chars) `+`\n",
    "* Subtraction: `-`\n",
    "* Division: `/`\n",
    "* Division with No Decimal: `//`\n",
    "* Modulo (calculate the remainder): `%`\n",
    "* Multiplication: `*`\n",
    "* Equality: `==`\n",
    "* Inequality: `>=` `<=` `>` `<` `!=`\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that applying these operators might actually *change* our data-types, especially as it applies to numeric values! Operators will always select the **most** general numeric-type as the data-type of the result when adding multiple types together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think back to the mathematical grouping of numbers. Rational numbers (floats) are the most general number-type (at least in Python). Whereas bools (which could be represented as 1 or 0) & ints are the most specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26397102/228243430-3485307d-07a4-47be-b337-4919e257d1ac.png)\n",

    "A feature of Python you all might have seen already in the domain of data-structures is packing & unpacking. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can pack a list using the `*` operator, and similarly unpack a list by placing the asterisk behind the list variable name as we pass it into a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**list packing**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a, *b, c = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**list unpacking**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def adder(a, b, c, d):\n",
    "    return a + b + c + d\n",
    "\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "adder(*x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies for dictionaries, except this time we utilize two asterisks `**`.\n",

    "## Command Line Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "We can actually take in \"arguments\" from a command line in our Python program. This is especially useful for when we are running programs from the terminal. As a refresher, we run programs using the python interpreter via `python filename.py`. Let's assume that this program prints out \"hello world\" once.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python filename.py 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Would print out \"hello world\" 10 times.\n",
    "\n",

    "for i in range(runtime):\n",
    "    print(\"hello world\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the `sys.argv` object acts as a list of command-line arguments. As we provide more arguments, our list of arguments also becomes larger (argument1 is sys.argv[1], argument 2 is sys.argv[2], etc). I challenge you all to inspect what `sys.argv[0]` holds... \n",
    "\n",
    "In compute-environments, all of our programs should be run in the terminal. Going forward, I want you all to run your `.py` files using the command `python filename.py` or `python3 filename.py` if you're on Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "This functionality is usually used in `.py` files as opposed to `jupyter` notebooks. Therefore, you will see a practice example in `cli.py` in the `fix-me-week2` exercise. "

    "## Imports & Python Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, to complete our engineering skill-set, we should also be aware of how we can import modules (aka Python files) into other modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "We usually take the pattern of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to import all the objects & methods of a single module. Keep in mind that if you do this, you must refer to that module at every instance that you want to refer to its objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# this gets the \"Var1\" variable from \"module_name\"\n",
    "module_name.var1\n",
    "\n",
    "# this gets the \"method\" function from \"module_name\"\n",
    "module_name.method()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to make your life easier, you can alias your module name so that you have less text to type out. This is especially useful if you are a \"one-finger\" typer like me:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module_name as mn\n",
    "\n",
    "mn.var1\n",
    "\n",
    "mn.method()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, if you only want certain variables or methods from your module, you should specify as such. This removes the need to refer to the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module_name import var1, method\n",
    "\n",
    "# this prints var1\n",
    "print(var1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# this calls the method\n",
    "print(method())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually done in `.py` files as opposed to `.ipynb` files (especially when we are composing a data pipeline).\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind, `.ipynb` is good for outward presentation. `.py` is good for engineering.\n",
