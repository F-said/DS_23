# Lab: Stepping Up

For this lab you will create a program that takes input from console and constructs [ASCII](https://theasciicode.com.ar/ascii-printable-characters/number-sign-ascii-code-35.html) cascading "stairs."

```
python stairs.py 
Insert how many levels of steps: 3

  ##
 ####
######

python stairs.py 
Insert how many levels of steps: 5

    ##
   ####
  ######
 ########
##########

python stairs.py 
Insert how many levels of steps: 0

python stairs.py 
Insert how many levels of steps: 1

##
```

If you feel comfortable with this task, then try out [quadratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function) stairs. 

```
python quad_stairs.py 
Insert how many levels of steps: 3

  ##
  ##

######


python fib_stairs.py 
Insert how many levels of steps: 4

   ##

python fib_stairs.py 
Insert how many levels of steps: 2
